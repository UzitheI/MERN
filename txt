//now to react with requests we create a route
app.get('/',(req,res)=>{
    res.json({mssg:'Welcome to the app'});
})
//here req is the request that is being sent and res is the response, whenever we get a request from the port 4000 that is siginified by / , we respond it to it by giving a json string which here is Welcome to the app
